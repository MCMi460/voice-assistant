# Voice Assistant
A Python-based Voice Assistant

### I know this is not well documented
I will update this README with a proper set of instructions for downloading this program and making it work when it is finalized, so give it time.

I will rarely update this, I just wanted to prove I could do it. You're on your own using it, feel free to edit and update this code, make a fork, pull request, whatever you want.

Controls:

"Open \<app\>" (opens an app of your choice)

"Play \<song\>" (gets from Youtube)

"Chat with me" (requires enabling in the main.py file - uses chatterbox python library as a chat bot to talk with you)
